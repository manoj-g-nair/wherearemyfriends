Where Are My Friends is an [Android](http://code.google.com/android) (version 1) application that plots all of the addresses from your contacts list onto a map.

After getting the addresses for everyone in your contact list, WamF places them all on a map, drawing lines that connect you to them. By the time we're done we'll have touched on maps, overlays, Location-Based Services, using native Content Providers, Adapters, the geocoder, and menus.
